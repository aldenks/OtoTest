## OtoTest ##
A hearing monitoring iOS app to help people taking potentially hearing damaging medications.

Ototoxic medications, such as some of those used to treat cystic fibrosis, are medications which can damage hearing as a side effect.  This app allows patients to monitor their hearing and catch hearing loss early.

This project is (obviously) in its early stages of development. If you think it might be helpful for you let us know. We intend to release it for free on the app store.
